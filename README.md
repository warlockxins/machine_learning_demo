# Machine learning demo

There is some training to do to understand how Machine learning works :D

## Problem

It is hard to learn and appreciate existing Neural network solutions. Most of them require programming skills just to input data, in `python` for example.

## Solution

To get a taste what it is really like, the simplified dashboard is needed, to quickly insert and train NN models.

This project is primarily for simplified educational purposes only.

## Usage

As a data scientist, I want to load a dataset in CSV format.

Then I see a snipet of dataset in table form.

Then I choose which data fields I want to use.

Then I choose provided data fields as input and output, also manually set if it is a numeric type or label.

Then I click **Learn** button and observe cheated Node visual graph.

When I click on a record row in the table, I observe text representation of predicted values.

If I am not satsified with predicted values, I click **Another Go!** button.
